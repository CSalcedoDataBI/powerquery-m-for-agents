"""Fail if the plugin manifest and the skills on disk disagree.

The skills sit under `skills/`, which is also where the default scan looks, so a wrong
list is no longer the difference between five skills and none. It is still worth
checking: `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` names each one by path, and a skill missing from
that list ships invisible without Claude Code complaining -- the docs are explicit that
when none of the listed paths exist the default scan runs instead. Before the move to
`skills/` that fallback found nothing at all, and the resulting plugin installed,
reported success, and loaded zero skills. It was reproduced before this check existed.
